# You wish you knew ActiveMQ?

A collection of information about ActiveMQ. Hosted on [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### First setup (if you want to test locally)

1. Install Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

[Follow this GitHub guide.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#building-your-site-locally) You can skip the perquisites section, it's confusing and covered by the step above.

### Important tip: if you ever need to run jekyll commands, do it as `bundle exec jekyll`, as per [the `Gemfile`](./Gemfile)!
